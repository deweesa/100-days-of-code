# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 27, Friday

**Today's Progress**: 
    - Created new repo for development on my personal site. Was in git hell 
      trying to git the locally created react app on branch `master` to the 
      remote branch `main`. 
    - Just made a simple landing page. Think I am going to use bootstrap moving
      to bootstrap has messed with the styling of the page a little bit. 

**Thoughts**: Moved pretty slow today. WIsh I was better at more advanced git 
          features so that I could have gotten out of git hell sooner. Also 
          wish that I had some more experience with web development and front
          end technologies.
